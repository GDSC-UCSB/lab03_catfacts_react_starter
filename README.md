# Cat Facts -- Using asynchronous APIs to fetch data in React.js 

### To-Do:
- [ ] Update the `getNewCatFact` function found in `src/api/catFactsAPI` to ping the provided URL and get some data back
- [ ] Update the `src/components/CatFacts/CatFacts.js` file to finish implementing the `updateFact` function. Be careful about async/await!

### Usage
Type `npm start` in the directory of the project to get it running.
The browser should open a new tab at `localhost:3000`. If it doesn't open this tab manually.
